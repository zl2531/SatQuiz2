om# SatQuiz2

This project is aimed to demonstrate an interactive quiz. That is when users click the button, the question will appear one by one in sequence. And when users finish all questions, a result container will pop up to give users feedback. I have three versions of the project. To meet the requirements set for this project, I included all elements required but it didn't function at all. So I have a 2nd and 3rd simplified versions. Finally it worked, but may not fulfil the requirements. I have posted links of three versions for reference.
